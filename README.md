# go-mp3

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/amanitaverna/go-mp3.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/amanitaverna/go-mp3)

The original go-mp3 is no longer maintained. This fork was made to add the ability to record the current position for later seeking, and for seeking forwards and backwards by a certain number of seconds.

# The original readme follows:

An MP3 decoder in pure Go based on [PDMP3](https://github.com/technosaurus/PDMP3).
